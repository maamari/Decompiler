This repository contains a simple stack-based decompiler. The implementation is provided in various languages, though I suggest the jupyter-notebook for initial consideration due to the cleanliness of the presentation.

To run the notebook, first make sure that you have jupyter-notebook installed on your system
	 pip install jupyter 


And then run the notebook accordingly:
	 jupyter-notebook aSimpleDecompiler.ipynb
